#I suggest only having 2 main scenes. One for experimental trial and One for game assembly.

#A 3rd scene can also be used for quick and dirty trials if you don't wanna disturb the experimental scene.

#Having more scenes than the suggestions are alright, but categorize these scenes within subfolders to make things clean and easy to access.
